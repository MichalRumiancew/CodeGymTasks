Today we invite you to write an exciting game &mdash; Moon Lander. As always, we&#39;ll start with the rules.
The objective is guide a landing module down to the lunar surface. To do this, the player must overcome the Moon&#39;s gravitational attraction,
using an aft booster to slow the descent and side thrusters to move the ship left or right.
The terrain is bumpy and there&#39;s only one flat area suitable for a soft landing. We&#39;ll call it the &quot;platform&quot;. If the player lands successfully, he or she wins.
The score depends on how long the landing lasts: The longer a player takes to land, the lower the final score.
The game ends when the player smashes into the surface of the Moon.
Well, let&#39;s start with the game&#39;s main class: MoonLanderGame.
We&#39;ll make it inherit the Game class.

This and other &quot;game engine&quot; classes are contained in the com.codegym.engine.cell package. To use them, the MoonLanderGame class must include the following import:
Now we&#39;ll implement the playing field. To do this, we need to override the initialize() method, which in turn must call the setScreenSize(int, int) method.
This method sets the playing field&#39;s width and height, which it takes as arguments. We&#39;ll store them in variables.

To complete the Moon Lander task successfully, we recommend that you read this article about the &quot;Games&quot; section. It contains information that you&#39;ll find helpful when writing games.
